# Soccer-SEQ2Event
**An RNN/Transformer model architecture for match event data.**

Part of COMP6200 MSc Data Science studies at the University of Southampton.  Code to import Wyscout open access match event dataset (details of which can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7) is provided in the first notebook.  Code implementation of the proposed Soccer-SEQ2Event model for match event prediction is provided in the second notebook.

Once graduation is completed in the coming months, I plan to share more details on the model protyping, rationale and suggestions for future research to this repository.
